# TravelReservationProject
Group project for CS336 at Rutgers. This project is a travel reservation application akin to Expedia, where customers are able to book flights.

This project utilized Java (JDBC, JSP, Servlets), Apache Tomcat (to run the web application), and MySQL Server (to run the backend database). I contributed to the schema of the database, as well as implementing a view for a customer service representative with the ability to edit or cancel bookings. I also generated data for the database to test our web application functions.
